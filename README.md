    <h1>Python Composition Relationship</h1>
    <p>In Python, composition is a type of relationship where one object is contained within another object and is dependent on it. This is achieved by a class using another class as a property or data member.</p>
    <p>For example, in a car class, there may be an engine class that is necessary for the car to function. In this case, the car class has an engine class and the engine class is essential for the car to move.</p>
    <p>The composition relationship is an important concept in object-oriented programming and is used in many programming languages including Python.</p>
